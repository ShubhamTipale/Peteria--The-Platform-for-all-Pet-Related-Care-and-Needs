# Peteria--The-Platform-for-all-Pet-Related-Care-and-Needs
1 INTRODUCTION 
 
This platform is a comprehensive hub designed to connect pet enthusiasts with a wide range of products and services essential for their pets' well-being. Whether you're a pet owner, a service provider, or someone passionate about the welfare of animals, this project offers a dynamic and supportive ecosystem.  
1.1 Purpose 
 
This Peteria Software Requirement Specification (SRS) main objective is to provide a base for the foundation of the project. It gives a comprehensive view of how the system is supposed to work and what is to be expected by the end users. Client’s expectation and requirements are analyzed to produce specific unambiguous functional and non-functional requirements, so they can be used by development team with clear understanding to build a system as per end user needs. 
 
This SRS for Peteria can also be used for future as basis for detailed understanding on how project was started. It provides a blueprint to upcoming new developers and maintenance teams to assist in maintaining and modifying this project as per required changeability. 
 
1.2 Need Of Peteria
 
Pets need care and attention to keep them healthy, happy, and safe. They need healthy food; clean, fresh water; and a comfortable place to sleep. Most pets also require regular exercise to stay fit. It is important to find out all about an animal before deciding whether it will fit in well with you or your family.
